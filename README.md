# Double Linked List Excercise

Your task is to implement a doubly linked list. Basic functions need to be
implemented and some tests currently exist to verify that it was indeed
implemented.

Not all functionality is tested and will require you to write tests to verify
that it works.

Good luck!

## Getting Started

1. Install gems. `bundle install`
2. Implement class in `lib/linked_list.rb`
3. Add more tests to `spec/linked_list_spec.rb`

## Testing

```sh
rspec spec
```
